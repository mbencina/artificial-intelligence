# Kakuro solver

### 2 alogrithms for solving a [Kakuro puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro)

Run *solver.py* to test both algorithms (one is defined in *solver.py* the other one in *backtracing.py*). 
The first one is similar to an algorithm people use for solving a Kakuro, the other one is a backtracing algorithm.
